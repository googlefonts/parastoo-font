# Parastoo Font

While this repo is a fork of [https://github.com/rastikerdar/parastoo-font](https://github.com/rastikerdar/parastoo-font), it has been completely reworked with the intention of publication on [Google Fonts](https://github.com/rastikerdar/parastoo-font).

As of May 2025, the Arabic language support of the font has not been expanded, but matched with the complete Latin set of [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?query=Lora) where previously only a small subset was included.

None of the original files remain in place. Please see the original repo for reference. The old Fontforge sources were turned into Glyph.app sources and the phyiscal size of the font matched to the old Parastoo binaries by adjusting both their vertical metrics as well as the UPM. 

Additionally, no kerning could be recovered from the old Fontforge sources and therefore modern-day class-based kerning was re-added to the Arabic.

As a result, the new fonts match the appearance of the original fonts as close as possible, but **must not** be regarded as completely indentical.
