    Parastoo is a refined Persian typeface designed by Saber Rastikerdar, developed with modern Farsi usage in both
    print and digital contexts in mind. Rooted in a traditional Naskh-inspired structure, Parastoo features clean lines,
    subtle serifs, and balanced proportions that give it a formal yet approachable appearance. It offers high
    readability and smooth visual flow, with moderate stroke contrast and thoughtful spacing that support long-form
    reading and dense text layouts.

    Designed primarily for Farsi, Parastoo ensures accurate rendering and typographic integrity in contemporary
    environments, addressing many of the localization and display issues found in older, legacy Farsi fonts. While it
    draws stylistic influence from classic typefaces such as B Nazanin, Parastoo modernizes the aesthetic and technical
    foundations to better suit todayâ€™s multilingual publishing needs. It retains compatibility with other Perso-Arabic
    script languages, making it a versatile choice for professional and editorial use.

    Please note that this is a <em>Persian-first</em> font and requires explicitly setting the Arabic language in your
    application to achieve standard Arabic text shaping.
